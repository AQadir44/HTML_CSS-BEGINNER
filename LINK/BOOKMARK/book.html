    <h1>PHYSICS</h1>
    <p>Physics is a branch of science which deals with the 
        various phenomenon occurring in the material universe 
        with practical and theoretical prove. Physics is made
         by Greek word meaning “Knowledge of nature” or 
        the physics can be called as the fundamental sciences.

        The main physics branches are :

    <h1 id="SEC1">CLASSICAL PHYSICS</h1>
    <p>
        Classical mechanics refers to the classical physics of bodies and forces
        Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism 
        are all examples of classical physics. Many theories in classical 
        physics break down when applied to extremely small objects 
        such as atoms or to objects moving near the speed of light

    <h1 id="SEC2">QUANTUM PHYSICS</h1>
    <p>
        Quantum mechanics is a weird branch of science. It consists of topics 
        that are hard to observe in nature. Quantum mechanics have a lot of ambiguity 
        and it's not easy to understand. Quantum mechanics is filled with cumbersome theorems.
        It deals mostly in minute particles,atoms, sub-atomic particles and 
        their motion,electromagnetic waves etc.These are still much in debate. 
    </p>
    <h1 id="SEC3">NUCLEAR PHYSICS</h1>
    <p>
        Nuclear physics, as the name implies, deals with the model and mechanics of the nucleus,
        Nuclear physics research is focused on understanding the matter composed of quarks and gluons, 
        which makes up 99% of the mass of the universe,most of this matter is found at the core of atoms, 
        the same atoms that comprise all we see around us (including ourselves).
    </p>
    <h1 id="SEC4">PARTICLE PHYSICS</h1>
    <p>
        Particle physics (also known as high energy physics) is a 
        branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that 
        constitute matter and radiation. Although the word particle can refer to 
        various types of very small objects 
        (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust).
